# My Windows Config

Still under heavy modifications

## HOW TO USE IT ?

Clone the repo to a tools folder on your C: Drive:
```git clone http://github.com/neavend/windows "C:\\Tools\\"```

Then add this folder to your path.<br>
Then copy the `Config.Ini` file to your `~/AppData/Roaming/bug.n/` folder.
Find a way to autostart bug.n and kill the windows explorer.<br><br>

In case of modifications of the windmenu, compile it yourself and copy the binary to your `Tools` folder.<br>
That's it, you're good to go !
Feel free to fork/merge request/issue the repo !
